jSlider is a very simple slide show plug in written for jQuery.
Setting up this slide show is fairly simple. A little familiarity with jQuery is assumed.

Instructions.
-------------

1. Make a simple html page.

2. Add jQuery library and the plug in file like this.
	<script src="jquery-1.6.2.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
	<script src="jquery.jSlider.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

3. Add a div like this in the body section of your html code. choose your own id name if needed.

	<div id=jSlider> <!-- Can be anything, just make sure to call plug in with the name -->
		<img src='slides/1.png' >
		<img src='slides/2.png' >
		<img src='slides/3.png' >
		<img src='slides/4.png' >
		<img src='slides/5.png' >
		<img src='slides/6.png' >
		<img id='default' src='slides/7.png'>
	</div>

	Keep one image as default. Not the first one because that will cause an animation delay.

4. Call the js function to activate the plug in.

	$(document).ready(function(){
		$('div#jSlider').jSlider({'interval':1500});
	});


You can have multiple sideshows in a single page with different speeds.
Examples :

1. $('div#jSlider').jSlider({'interval':1500}); for custom speed in milliseconds or
2. $('div#jSlider2').jSlider(); for the default speed 2000ms.

Timing wont be very accurate when multiple sideshows are used. Blame JS and not me for it.
Enjoy the plugin, its super light and < 1KB.
